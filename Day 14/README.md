# C Programming: Conditionals, Loops & Applications

This repository contains various beginner to intermediate-level C programs focusing on conditionals (if-else, switch), loops, user input, string handling, and number processing.

## Files Overview & Key Concepts

### 1. `if_else_example.c`
- Demonstrates the use of `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.
- Validates a userâ€™s age and checks voting eligibility.

### 2. `switch_day_of_week.c`
- Takes a number (1 to 7) and prints the corresponding day of the week using `switch`.

### 3. `switch_astrology.c`
- Calculates the life path number from a date input.
- Uses a `switch` statement to print a short astrology message.
- ![ex2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d7278ef-c48e-480d-946a-044a7d336df4)


### 4. `loop_sum_product.c`
- Iterates through an integer array.
- Calculates and prints the summation and multiplication of all elements.
- ![ex3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a548e10-4e2f-440c-8e76-0eadec05f9cc)


### 5. `while_loop_1to10.c`
- Prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.
- ![ex4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/074538b3-d640-46c0-be91-62c4a5100ce0)


### 6. `fibonacci_series.c`
- Generates the Fibonacci series up to a user-specified number of terms.
- ![ex5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b2edb42-ba4f-46ee-aea9-94bdc1e0c3a0)


### 7. `factorial_calculator.c`
- Takes a non-negative number and calculates its factorial using a `for` loop.
- ![ex6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3e6002d-db85-4c76-9a4d-01e947a9eb56)


### 8. `string_concatenation.c`
- Accepts two strings from the user.
- Concatenates and displays them using `strcat()`.
- ![ex7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c048f03-20fb-450b-8184-87fc85f096a5)


### 9. `binary_to_decimal.c`
- Converts a binary number (input as an integer) to its decimal equivalent.
- ![ex8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/662042b1-be28-48bc-adb5-9b83f1d96821)

### 10. `max_min_array.c`
- Takes a set of integers from the user.
- Finds and displays the maximum and minimum values in the array.
- ![ex9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4218b3e3-1517-4cc1-9eba-ec47d05e0d1b)


### 11. `pascals_triangle.c`
- Prints Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows.
- Uses a custom factorial function to compute binomial coefficients.
- ![ex10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d5cded8-9425-49d5-9aec-237f5e8c14b5)


## How to Compile and Run
Make sure you have a C compiler like GCC installed.

```sh
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
```

Example:
```sh
gcc factorial_calculator.c -o factorial
./factorial
```

## Highlights
- Use of `if-else` and `switch` for decision-making.
- Mastery of different loop types (`for`, `while`).
- User interaction with `scanf()` and formatted output with `printf()`.
- String operations using standard library functions.
- Algorithmic applications like Fibonacci, Factorials, and Pascal's Triangle.
