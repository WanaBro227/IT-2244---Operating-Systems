# C Programming: Conditionals, Loops & Applications

This repository contains various beginner to intermediate-level C programs focusing on conditionals (if-else, switch), loops, user input, string handling, and number processing.

## Files Overview & Key Concepts

### 1. `if_else_example.c`
- Demonstrates the use of `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.
- Validates a userâ€™s age and checks voting eligibility.

### 2. `switch_day_of_week.c`
- Takes a number (1 to 7) and prints the corresponding day of the week using `switch`.

### 3. `switch_astrology.c`
- Calculates the life path number from a date input.
- Uses a `switch` statement to print a short astrology message.

### 4. `loop_sum_product.c`
- Iterates through an integer array.
- Calculates and prints the summation and multiplication of all elements.

### 5. `while_loop_1to10.c`
- Prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.

### 6. `fibonacci_series.c`
- Generates the Fibonacci series up to a user-specified number of terms.

### 7. `factorial_calculator.c`
- Takes a non-negative number and calculates its factorial using a `for` loop.

### 8. `string_concatenation.c`
- Accepts two strings from the user.
- Concatenates and displays them using `strcat()`.

### 9. `binary_to_decimal.c`
- Converts a binary number (input as an integer) to its decimal equivalent.

### 10. `max_min_array.c`
- Takes a set of integers from the user.
- Finds and displays the maximum and minimum values in the array.

### 11. `pascals_triangle.c`
- Prints Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows.
- Uses a custom factorial function to compute binomial coefficients.

## How to Compile and Run
Make sure you have a C compiler like GCC installed.

```sh
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
```

Example:
```sh
gcc factorial_calculator.c -o factorial
./factorial
```

## Highlights
- Use of `if-else` and `switch` for decision-making.
- Mastery of different loop types (`for`, `while`).
- User interaction with `scanf()` and formatted output with `printf()`.
- String operations using standard library functions.
- Algorithmic applications like Fibonacci, Factorials, and Pascal's Triangle.
